\chapter{Abstract}

This terminal project presents a proposal to implement a remote monitoring system aimed at aiding animal conservation. The approach involves utilizing a wireless sensor network (WSN), a swarm of drones, and a web server to offer an alternative to traditional methods with various limitations and challenges. The proposal suggests that the drone swarm collects information gathered by the WSN. Two data collection schemes are introduced, with a focus on comparing their energy consumption and flight time. Throughout the project, a successful collaboration was established with researchers from INECOL, actively engaging in monitoring the white-tailed deer. The document concludes with the proposed analysis and design, along with some preliminary results.
